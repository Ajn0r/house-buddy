# The House Buddy

For my fourth project with Code Institue, I have created a website to store and organize receipts and other documents.
The website was created to store mainly receipts regarding properties, however, the user can create their own customized categories to fit their needs.

## Strategy plane
---
### Who would the user be?
---
The user could be anybody wanting to keep track and store receipts or other property-related documents.

The user could also be any of the 6 million people living in Sweden owning a property, or any other country that has the same tax rules as Sweden.

### Why would a user want this?
---
The main purpose of the app is to make it easier for the user to keep track of all the receipts, saving them all in one place. The user can sort them into different categories that they have created themselves to fit their need.

The site is especially useful for property owners in Sweden.
#### **Why?**

In Sweden, homeowners must pay a tax on the profit if they sell their property, which is at 22% today. 
However, the tax can be reduced by the amount spent on home improvements, the cost of materials mainly, but also all other sorts of improvements that increase the value of the property, such as flowers and other small items.
Itâ€™s up to the homeowner to save and keep track of all the receipts, which can be a hassle, especially since it can add up to quite a few receipts of small sums, that in the end can result in a considerable grand total. 

Another perspective is the real estate agent side of it, they are the ones who must put all the receipts together and send them to the tax office.  
More times than often they will be handed a bag of receipts from the homeowners, and then have to do the time-consuming task of sorting, adding and putting it all together, a workload that they could do without. Being able to retrieve all the receipts digitally from the start would save them a ton of time and work, maybe also making it possible to lower the commission as a bonus for the homeowners.

### What value will it add?
---
For all users it will add value in the sense that they will have all their receipts and information in one place, making it easier to find them if needed for warranty or other inquiries. 

Moreover, for the Swedish homeowners, it will add value in the sense that they can save money on the profit tax, in a hassle-free way.

### What is already out there
---
Looking through forums on the subject I found that people still use maps and folders to store receipts manually, they found it difficult to use an online cloud service, this will make it easy for the user to snap a photo of the receipts and upload it to elective category. House Buddy is designed so that even the not-so-technical person should be able to use this website.
