                        Did you know that you have to pay a 22% tax on the profit if you sell your property in
                        Sweden?
                        <br> We know, that's quite a lot!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But did you also know that you can reduce that amount by saving all of your receipts that
                        have
                        to do with home improvements?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's up to you as a homeowner to keep track of all of these, which can be a hurdle, to say
                        the
                        least!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With House Buddy, you can store them all in one place, so when the day comes for you to sell
                        your home, you will have them all in one place, not missing out on a penny!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most homeowners only save receipts when they buy or invest in expensive improvements, but it
                        can
                        be as little as buying new perennials for the garden, in the end, it will lead up to a huge
                        saving on tax, that's more money in your pocket!
